# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ballistic Homeroom

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Make a text based story game using Ren Py. It will have text, characters, and choices.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The text based story game will be made with Ren Py. It tells a story and gives you interactive choices. The assets
being used will be from the public domain. The immersive story will be around 10 to 15 minutes of gameplay. The finished product will be functional and will
run properly.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working game with an ending

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A working game with alternative endings

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An interesting game with 10 - 15 minutes of gameplay that runs without issues. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I should learn how Ren Py works, specifically what can it do and what it can't. I will need to learn how to make simple prompts and have choices given to the player. 
I need to learn about what makes a good story game. Along the way I'll need to look up how to make more than one ending. Hopefully if I have enough time I will try to include
different endings to the story.
