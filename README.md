# Difficulties
Finding/using free public domain assets. Encountered writer's block. Had to look up Ren'Py documentation. Time consuming coding/working alone.

# Learned
How to use Ren'Py at a beginner level. Where to find assets people upload for free use. More familiar with what the public domain encompasses/working with it in mind. Image types such as jpg vs png. File paths and locations.

# Enjoyed
Making a story game from scratch/Happy with finished product. Included my friend's avatars as sprites. Sense of accomplishment from fixing a problem I was stuck on.
